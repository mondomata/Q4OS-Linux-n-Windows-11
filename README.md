How

Why?
Q4OS is based on debian12 linux distro.
The setup exe run to windows app, and do not mode windows bootable partition.
But it is run dual booting with Windows os.
Lightweight, and elegant.
If you are think, uninstall nature, or if you are think is good, maybe install to first op.system.
Net, stream, work, game, etc...Q4OS rock stable, in beauty features, and lite to windows-users.
